You will need to position and resize the added costumes in the **Paint editor** to match your other costumes.

**Tip:** If you position a sprite on the Stage and then switch costume the sprite might appear to ‘jump’ or change size. You will need to position and resize the costumes in the **Paint editor** so that they all appear in the right position on the Stage.
